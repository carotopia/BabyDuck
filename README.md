# BabyDuckCompiler

A compiler for the fictional **BabyDuck** language, developed in Go using ANTLR for lexical and syntactic analysis.

## Project Structure

* `main.go` - Main entry point of the compiler. Reads the source file (`.bd`), analyzes it, and displays:
    * The Function Directory (functions and variables table).
    * Any semantic errors found.

* `grammar/` - Contains files generated by ANTLR from the `BabyDuck.g4` grammar. This folder includes:
    * Lexer and parser.
    * Base listener for implementing semantic logic.

* `symbols/` - Defines data structures used to represent:
    * Variable symbol table.
    * Function directory.
    * Parameters, types, values, and simulated addresses.

* `semantic/` - Includes the **semantic cube**, responsible for validating operations between compatible types (e.g., `int + float`).

* `builder/` - Implements listeners that build and validate the Function Directory as the syntax tree generated by ANTLR is traversed.

## Execution

To compile and run the project, use:

```bash
go run main.go test.bd
```

This command:
* Analyzes the `test.bd` file.
* Prints the functions and variables table.
* Shows semantic errors (e.g., incorrectly called functions, undeclared variables, etc.).

## Dependencies

* ANTLR v4
* Go 1.20 or hi
